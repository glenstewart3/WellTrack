# WellTrack — MTSS Platform PRD

## Original Problem Statement
Build a School MTSS (Multi-Tiered System of Supports) platform named **WellTrack** that integrates:
- A behavioral screener (SAEBRS) completed by teachers
- A student self-report wellbeing system (SAEBRS+)
- Attendance tracking with tiering
- Intervention management
- Analytics and reporting

---

## Core User Personas
- **Admin**: Full access — settings, imports, data management
- **Leadership**: Reports, meeting prep, alerts approval
- **Wellbeing Staff**: Interventions, case notes, AI suggestions
- **Screener/Teacher**: Complete screenings for their class

## 3rd Party Integrations
- **Custom Google OAuth2** (authlib + SessionMiddleware)
- **openpyxl** — XLSX file parsing
- **httpx** — Ollama API calls (AI suggestions)
- **jsPDF + jspdf-autotable** — PDF generation
- **APScheduler** — Daily automated backups

---

## Key DB Collections
- `students` — {student_id, first_name, preferred_name, last_name, sussi_id, external_id, class_name, year_level, teacher, ...}
- `school_settings` — {accent_color, platform_name, tier_thresholds, excluded_absence_types, terms: [{name, start_date, end_date, non_school_days}], ...}
- `saebrs_results` — Teacher-led SAEBRS screening results
- `saebrs_plus_results` — Student self-report results
- `attendance_records` — Exception-based records (absent students only) indexed on student_id + date
- `school_days` — Set of term dates (from Settings → Calendar)
- `interventions` — {intervention_id, student_id, type, staff, status, goals, progress_notes, ...}
- `case_notes` — {case_id, student_id, note_type, notes, staff_member, date, ...}
- `alerts` — {alert_id, type: 'early_warning'|'tier_change', status: 'pending'|'approved'|'rejected', ...}
- `users` — {email, name, picture, role, password_hash}

- `GET /api/students/summary` — Students list with tier/attendance/saebrs (batch-optimized)
- `POST /api/attendance/upload` — Exception-based attendance upload (robust CSV/XLSX parser)
- `GET /api/school-days` — List of uploaded school days
- `GET /api/analytics/school-wide` — Overview with tier_distribution, risk_distribution (batch-optimized)

- `GET /api/analytics/tier-distribution` — Tier counts (batch-optimized)
- `GET /api/analytics/cohort-comparison` — Cohort breakdown (batch-optimized)
- `GET /api/meeting-prep` — Returns {students, tier_changes} (batch-optimized)
- `POST /api/interventions/ai-suggest/{student_id}` — Ollama AI suggestions
- `GET /api/reports/support-gaps` — Students needing intervention (batch-optimized)
- `GET /api/reports/screening-coverage` — Coverage by class (batch-optimized)
- `GET /api/reports/tier-summary-csv` — CSV export (batch-optimized)

## What's Been Implemented (see CHANGELOG.md for details)
- ✅ Google OAuth + Email/Password authentication
- ✅ Onboarding wizard
- ✅ Student management (add, import CSV, edit, archive/reactivate)
- ✅ SAEBRS screening workflow
- ✅ SAEBRS+ self-report
- ✅ Attendance tracking — robust XLSX/CSV parser, exception-based, AM/PM dedup
- ✅ Term-based calendar (Settings → Calendar) for accurate attendance %
- ✅ Automatic tiering from attendance + SAEBRS
- ✅ Alert system (tier changes + early warnings)
- ✅ Interventions with Ollama AI suggestions
- ✅ Analytics & Reports — 6 tabs, global filter, PDF export
- ✅ MTSS Meeting Prep page
- ✅ Student Profile with screening history charts
- ✅ Automated daily JSON backups (APScheduler, 30-day retention)
- ✅ Configurable demo data (specify student count)
- ✅ Absence type toggles (exclude from attendance calculation)
- ✅ **N+1 query elimination** — all multi-student endpoints use batch DB queries
- ✅ **MongoDB indexes** — on student_id, date, status for fast queries

## Prioritized Backlog

### P0 — None (all critical issues resolved)

### P1 — Upcoming
- Email system (deferred by user): automated alert notifications — needs email provider choice (Resend or SendGrid)

### P2 — Medium Priority
- **Chronic absentee badge** on Students page (>10% absence within a term)
- **Wellbeing Check-in**: Simple daily wellbeing check-in for students (on hold by user)
- **Automated Weekly Backups**: Email a weekly data backup to the admin

### P3 — Nice to Have
- Email notifications for alerts
- Update self-hosted deployment guide for new auth system
- Export all student data as CSV filtered by cohort

---

## Known Issues / Notes
- Ollama AI suggestions require Ollama to be running locally (returns 503 if not available)
- PDF export uses browser-side jsPDF (no server dependency)
- The `school_days` collection is populated via Settings → Calendar terms, not from attendance uploads
